<h2>What is midi?</h2>
<p>Midi is the type of music files that Tenuto Tutor can play.</p>
<p>Midi files contain note and volume information that are sent to the robot. It can’t read sheet music or interpret MP3 files.</p>
<p>You can find midi files of your favourite songs online, but make sure to use legitimate sources to avoid malware damaging your data. To be sure, you can download files from the website we recommend when you try to upload a song (<a href="https://www.midiworld.com/files/" target="_blank">Link</a>). You can also create your own midi files and upload them from your device.</p>
<p>More technically speaking,</p>
<p>A basic MIDI file contains three crucial bytes of information that we consider:</p>
<p>- Note on/note off </p>
<p>- Note value 0-127, 60 = middle c (pitch) </p>
<p>- Velocity value 0-127</p>
<p>Every ‘note on’ byte will correspond to a signal being sent to a solenoid, the note value will determine which solenoid this signal is sent to and the velocity value will control the PWM of the signal.</p>

<h2>What is a bar?</h2>
<p>A bar is one small segment of a song that holds a number of beats. (A beat is the basic rhythmic unit of a measure, it’s often the underlying pulse of a given piece of music.)</p>
<p>Most pop songs are around 80 bars long, but this completely depends on each song.</p>
<h2>What is a BPM?</h2>
<p>Beats per minute (bpm) is a measure of speed that tells you how many beats (a beat is the basic rhythmic unit of a measure, it’s often the underlying pulse of a given piece of music) are played per minute. If you have more beats per minute, that means the song will be played faster – squeezing more of it into a minute.</p>
